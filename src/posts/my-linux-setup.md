For my own reference, this is a setup that I'm currently comfortable with:
- Garuda Linux with KDE Lite
- Dolphin file explorer
- Chrome as my browser
- Fish shell
- gedit
- GNOME terminal (even though I don't use GNOME)
- Spectacle for screenshots and short screen recordings
- OBS studio for longer screen recordings (and capturing the webcam feed)
- VS code
