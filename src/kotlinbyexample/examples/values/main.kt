// Kotlin has various types including strings, integers, floats, booleans, etc. Here are a few basic examples.

fun main() {
    // Strings, which can be added together with `+`.
    println("kot" + "lin")

    // Integers and floats.
    println(1 + 1)
    println(7.0 / 3.0)

    // Booleans, with boolean operators as youâ€™d expect.
    println(true && false)
    println(true || false)
    println(!true)
}
